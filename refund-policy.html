    <h1>Refund & Campaign Extension Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective for all campaigns under AdVantage Ads and its sub-brands</strong> (including TechSell Boosters, RemedyFunnels, GlowLead Plug, etc.)</p>

    <h2>1. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>We operate with transparency and clear communication. However, due to the nature of digital advertising and campaign setup, our refund policy follows the guidelines below:</p>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ Setup Fees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Setup fees are non-refundable. Once we begin work â€” including strategy planning, creative design, or ad setup â€” the setup fee is fully committed and cannot be refunded.</li>
      <li>If you make payment and request cancellation before work begins, a partial refund may be issued after deducting any admin or processing charges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ Ad Budget</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ad budget is non-refundable once the campaign has been launched. Once ads go live on Facebook/Instagram, the budget is actively spent and cannot be recovered.</li>
      <li>If your campaign has not yet started and you wish to cancel, your ad budget may be refunded in full or in part â€” depending on whether any pre-launch work has begun.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ UGC or Creative Fees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fees paid for UGC videos or custom creatives are non-refundable once production begins.</li>
      <li>You will own the creative once completed and may reuse it as you wish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Campaign Extension Policy</h2>
    <p>We understand that most clients may want to continue their campaigns if they see good results. Hereâ€™s how extensions work:</p>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ What Happens When the Ad Budget Is Exhausted?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You will be notified once your weekly ad budget is almost used up.</li>
      <li>If you want to continue running the campaign, you simply need to pay a new weekly ad budget + a small weekly ad management fee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ Extension Fees:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WhatsApp DM Campaigns:</strong> â‚¦7,500 weekly management fee</li>
      <li><strong>Funnel Campaigns:</strong> â‚¦10,000 weekly management fee</li>
      <li>This fee covers:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ongoing optimization and monitoring</li>
        <li>Updating audience or creatives (if needed)</li>
        <li>Daily check-ins to ensure your ads perform better over time</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>ðŸ”¹ Do I Pay a New Setup Fee Every Time I Extend?</h3>
    <p>No â€” setup fees are one-time per campaign.</p>
    <p>You only pay a new setup fee if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to promote a different product</li>
      <li>You request major changes to your creatives, strategy, or target audience</li>
      <li>You want to change from a DM campaign to a Funnel (or vice versa)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these cases, a new campaign must be built from scratch, which requires a new setup process.</p>

    <h2>3. UGC Add-ons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>UGC (User-Generated Content) videos or testimonials are optional but recommended for performance.</li>
      <li>If requested, UGC is charged separately (â‚¦20,000)</li>
      <li>This cost is non-refundable once production begins</li>
      <li>You own the final video and can reuse it in future campaigns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads can take a few days to stabilize due to Facebook learning phase â€” patience helps performance improve.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee sales; we guarantee professional setup, tracking, and support.</li>
      <li>If you do not want to continue after the first 7 days, no pressure â€” but we recommend 2â€“3 weeks for full impact.</li>
    </ul>
